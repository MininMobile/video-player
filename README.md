# video-player
A simple html5 video player.

## Usage
Put `.mp4` of video in `Media` directory.

For when you want to use a video in your website, copy
& paste `video.html` and edit it to work with your
website's styling and structure, then the main `videoWrapper`
element will be what houses your video, so design your
website around that.

(Yes, I know it's a pretty bad way to implement it b-but
I'm working on it! <3)
